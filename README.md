# System wide text completion

I long had the desire to write something that makes my life easyer in terms of managing my passowrds, like a password manager but locally, and open source so that i know it can be trust. And honestly i havent even checked for alternatives since i found this idear a good excuse to pracice C and write my own data structures ETC.



## Features (i want to add)

- Text completion e.g: when you type .e1 -> email1@gmail.com pr .p1 -> password1
- Autocompletion 
- Autocorrection
- Text mood detection
- etc. no idear about the other honestly
